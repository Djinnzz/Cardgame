*1 those attack stats mean flat attack, there can be creatures that have some kind of effect that makes their attack or defense stat variable and where it is possible to get higher numbers than stated.
*2 those numbers are generell guidelines, this doesnt mean that there cant be creatures with higher stats. 
*3 if a monster gets more attack or more defense than stated up top, it should have an effect that balances all of this. Something like sacrifice a spell card everytime you want to attack or stuff like that.
